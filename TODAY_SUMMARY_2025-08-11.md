# Daily Summary (2025-08-11)

## What was built/changed
- Integrated Brand Detection module into audit flow
  - Added `brand_mentions` JSON field to `app/models/response.py` and created alembic migration.
  - Wired detection in `app/tasks/audit_tasks.py` to analyze AI responses and persist results.
  - Exposed orchestrator/engine via `app/services/brand_detection/__init__.py`.
- Database & migrations
  - Generated migration `b00e2b865774_add_brand_mentions_to_response_model.py`.
  - Cleaned the migration to only add `responses.brand_mentions` (removed unintended type changes).
  - Temporarily adjusted alembic connection to localhost for migration, then reverted to Docker service names.
- Brand Detection engine improvements
  - Candidate extraction: fixed regex and case sensitivity to better capture proper nouns.
  - Performance: introduced batched hybrid similarity in `similarity.py` and `detector.py` (batch 20), plus simple embedding cache (via `cachetools`).
  - Sentiment: fixed `UnboundLocalError` in `sentiment.py` by initializing weights.
- Adapter logic
  - Iterated on `GermanMarketAdapter` validation; ultimately set `_market_specific_validation` to permissive (return True) to maximize recall while we rely on similarity thresholds for precision.
- Tooling & deps
  - Added `cachetools==5.3.0` to `requirements.txt`.
  - Updated/verified numpy, torch, sentence-transformers, pytest-benchmark per environment needs.
- Example & verification
  - `example_usage.py` updated to pass explicit `DetectionConfig(market_code="DE")`.
  - Verified runs: saw both low-recall and high-recall outcomes; confirmed validation rules were suppressing matches; with permissive validation, all target brands were detected.

## Key errors, causes, and fixes
- Alembic could not resolve DB host `db`
  - Cause: running alembic outside Docker; service hostname not resolvable.
  - Fix: temporarily hardcoded `localhost` in alembic `env.py`; reverted after migration.
- Alembic autogenerate attempted unintended schema changes (client id types)
  - Cause: model metadata import set exposed type diffs; autogenerate picked them up.
  - Fix: pruned migration to only add `responses.brand_mentions`.
- `ModuleNotFoundError: cachetools`
  - Cause: new cache usage without dependency.
  - Fix: added `cachetools==5.3.0` to `requirements.txt` and installed.
- Sentiment `UnboundLocalError` (business sentiment)
  - Cause: weights referenced outside conditional.
  - Fix: initialize `linguistic_weight`/`business_weight` before branch.
- Brand recall failures (Salesforce/HubSpot not detected)
  - Causes:
    - Overly strict validation logic in `GermanMarketAdapter` (especially capitalization heuristics at sentence starts/compound handling).
    - Candidate extraction initially too permissive/too restrictive depending on regex and flags.
  - Fixes:
    - Adjusted candidate regex and removed global IGNORECASE.
    - Ultimately set `_market_specific_validation` to permissive `return True` so similarity thresholds (fuzzy/semantic) control acceptance.
- Performance slowdowns (>150s initially)
  - Cause: per-pair OpenAI embedding calls with no batching.
  - Fix: batched hybrid similarity and simple embedding cache; typical run ~1â€“2s now.

## Current state (end of day)
- Audit integration is complete; `brand_mentions` is persisted with responses.
- Engine detects brands; DE adapter validation is permissive (high recall) and relies on thresholds for precision.
- Example run performance ~1s; semantic step sometimes logs "slow operation" (threshold=1s).

## Things to keep in mind / next steps
- Precision filters (to re-introduce cautiously after recall is verified):
  - Minimal capitalization check: first token uppercase for fuzzy matches.
  - Simple blacklist for obvious non-brands (configurable stoplist).
  - Optional context filter: require surrounding sentence to include business keywords (adapter-specific), gated by confidence.
  - Keep these filters behind config flags to toggle recall vs precision profiles.
- Performance hardening:
  - Persist embedding cache (e.g., Redis) keyed by text hash to avoid recomputing across runs.
  - Consider disabling semantic step in "fast" profile or raising fuzzy weight for short texts.
  - Batch size/brand form limits are tunable; current values: batch=20, forms per brand=3.
- Migrations & environments:
  - When running locally, alembic requires a reachable Postgres on `localhost`; in Docker, use service `db`.
  - Avoid committing env-specific changes to `alembic/env.py`.
- Testing:
  - Add unit tests for candidate extraction, adapter validation (with both permissive and strict modes), and end-to-end detection for sample German texts.
  - Add regression tests for the sentiment weight initialization bug.
- API keys & config:
  - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set; example uses environment loading.
