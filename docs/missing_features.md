# AEO Audit Tool: Technical Debt & Future Tasks

This document serves as a living log of technical debt and pending tasks. It is organized by priority to guide future development and ensure the long-term health of the codebase.

---

## 1. Critical for Production

*These items are non-negotiable for a production deployment. They address core security, stability, and operational requirements.*

-   **Secrets Management**:
    -   Implement a proper secrets manager (e.g., Doppler, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to handle all API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data. The current `.env` file solution is for local development only.

-   **Asynchronous Task Processing**:
    -   Properly configure Celery for asynchronous execution in production using a suitable pool like `gevent` or `eventlet`.
    -   Refactor the `run_audit_task` to be fully asynchronous in production to avoid blocking workers.

-   **Structured Logging & Error Tracking**:
    -   Implement structured logging (JSON format) using `structlog` across both FastAPI and Celery.
    -   Integrate an error tracking service like Sentry to capture and alert on unhandled exceptions.

## 2. High-Impact Tasks

*These items provide significant value by improving the development process, enhancing visibility, and expanding core functionality.*

-   **API Documentation Publication**:
    -   Automate the publication of the OpenAPI schema to a public-facing documentation platform (e.g., Stoplight, ReadMe, or a static site generator).

-   **Comprehensive Integration & E2E Testing**:
    -   Expand the test suite to cover more scenarios, including different API responses, failure modes, and edge cases.
    -   Set up a dedicated testing environment that more closely mirrors production, including a live Celery worker and database.

-   **Performance Optimization**:
    -   Monitor application performance to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
    -   Optimize database queries and API calls to ensure scalability.

## 3. Quality & Maintenance

*These items focus on maintaining a high-quality codebase and reducing friction for future development.*

-   **Dependency Management**:
    -   Review and update dependencies regularly to patch security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility.
    -   Consider adopting a more robust dependency management tool like `poetry` or `pip-tools`.

-   **Code Quality & Linting**:
    -   Enforce formatting and linting rules consistently across the codebase.
    -   Periodically review the code for refactoring opportunities to reduce complexity and improve readability.

-   **Database Migration Strategy**:
    -   Establish a clear process for creating, reviewing, and applying database migrations to prevent data loss and schema drift.
