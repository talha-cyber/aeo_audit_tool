# Report Generator v2 Implementation Progress

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Database Migration
- [x] Metrics Layer Implementation
- [x] Chart Generation Module
- [x] Report Chassis Upgrade
- [x] Theming & Localization System
- [x] Section Builders
- [x] Data Loading Enhancement
- [x] Recommendations Engine
- [x] Accessibility Features
- [x] Integration & Testing

### üöß In Progress
- All core implementation completed!

### ‚ùå Not Compatible/Skipped Features

#### Features Not Implemented Due to Codebase Incompatibility:
1. **PDF/A Compliance** - Requires post-processing with Ghostscript, not available in current environment
2. **Custom TTF Font Embedding** - No custom fonts available, using system fonts (Helvetica family)
3. **Advanced Localization with Custom Locales** - Limited to basic en_US/de_DE support using existing Babel
4. **Database-stored Themes** - Implementing as code-based themes instead for simplicity
5. **Complex Category Analysis** - Current data model doesn't have detailed category breakdowns
6. **Advanced Prior-period Comparison** - Will implement basic version, complex matching logic may be limited

#### Modified Approaches:
1. **Sentiment Analysis Integration** - Using existing VADER-based sentiment system instead of implementing new one
2. **Chart Implementation** - Following existing chart instructions from CHART_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. **Database Schema** - Adding only essential fields to avoid complex migrations
4. **Accessibility** - Best-effort implementation within ReportLab limitations

## Detailed Progress Log

### Phase 1: Foundation & Database
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Tasks**:
- [x] Create database migration for new fields (responses.sentiment, audit_runs.prompt_basket_version, reports.template_version, reports.theme_key)
- [x] Implement metrics calculation functions (SAIV, sentiment aggregation, deltas)
- [x] Set up v2 directory structure (app/reports/v2/ with sections/)

### Phase 2: Visual & Structure Upgrade
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Tasks**:
- [x] Implement chart generation with matplotlib (SAIV bar charts, platform donuts, competitive analysis, sentiment comparison)
- [x] Upgrade to BaseDocTemplate (professional headers/footers, page templates, ToC support)
- [x] Add accessibility features (bookmarks, outline, alt text captions)

### Phase 3: Content & Experience
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Tasks**:
- [x] Create theme system (multi-theme support with color palettes, typography, localization)
- [x] Build modular section generators (title, summary, competitive, platforms, recommendations)
- [x] Implement localization helpers (date/number formatting with Babel fallbacks)

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Polish
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Tasks**:
- [x] Connect real sentiment data (integrated with existing VADER sentiment analyzer)
- [x] Build recommendations engine (data-driven 30-60-90 day plans with effort√óimpact analysis)
- [x] Add prior-period comparison (automatic previous audit detection and delta calculations)

### Phase 5: Quality & Integration
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Tasks**:
- [x] Add accessibility features (PDF bookmarks, alt text, document metadata)
- [x] Integrate with existing system (v2 report types in ReportGenerator, backward compatibility)
- [x] Create comprehensive tests (import validation, functionality tests, integration tests)

## Notes
- Using existing sentiment analysis system (VADER-based)
- Charts will follow CHART_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md approach
- Focus on best-in-class client reports with SAIV calculations
- Maintain backward compatibility with v1 reports

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

The Report Generator v2 has been successfully implemented with all core features:

### What's New in v2:
1. **Professional PDF Structure**: BaseDocTemplate with headers, footers, page numbers, and Table of Contents
2. **Real SAIV Calculations**: Share of AI Voice metrics with proper competitive analysis
3. **Advanced Charts**: Matplotlib-generated visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, sentiment comparison)
4. **Sentiment Integration**: Using existing VADER sentiment analyzer for real sentiment scores
5. **Multi-Theme Support**: Professional themes with localization (English/German support)
6. **Accessibility Features**: PDF bookmarks, alt text, document metadata
7. **Data-Driven Recommendations**: 30-60-90 day implementation plans with effort√óimpact matrix
8. **Prior-Period Comparison**: Automatic trend analysis and delta calculations

### How to Use v2:
```python
from app.services.report_generator import ReportGenerator

# Initialize with database session
generator = ReportGenerator(db_session)

# Generate v2 report (new report types)
report_path = generator.generate_audit_report(
    audit_run_id="your-audit-id",
    report_type="v2_comprehensive",  # or "v2", "v2_enhanced"
    output_dir="reports/"
)
```

### Available Report Types:
- `"v2"` or `"v2_comprehensive"` - Default theme professional report
- `"v2_enhanced"` - Corporate theme with enhanced styling
- Legacy types (`"comprehensive"`, `"summary"`, `"platform_specific"`) still work

### Database Migration Required:
Run the migration to add new fields: `alembic upgrade head`
